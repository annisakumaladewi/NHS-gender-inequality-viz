# NHS Gender Inequality – Data Visualisation Project

## Overview
This project revisits a data-driven article I wrote during my summer internship at *Distilled Post* (June–September 2021), which explored gender inequality in the NHS before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The aim of this repository is to strengthen the original article using new data visualisations created in **R (ggplot2)**, while showcasing my data visualisation, design, and storytelling skills. The focus is on making complex inequality data accessible to a general audience through clear, well-designed charts.

## Visualisations Included
The project includes four core visualisations:
- Line chart: Gender pay gap (mean vs median) over time  
- Line chart: Bonus pay gap (mean vs median)  
- Barbell chart: Bonus pay gap between women and men  
- Stacked bar chart: Ethnic composition of NHS staff by pay band  

All charts were designed with simplicity, readability, and editorial storytelling in mind.
